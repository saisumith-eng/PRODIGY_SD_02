I built a fun Python application using Tkinter where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. The app provides instant feedback (too high / too low), tracks the number of attempts, and even has a reset option to start a new game.

This project helped me strengthen my Python programming, GUI development, and problem-solving skills.

 Tech Stack: Python, Tkinter
 Features:

Random number generation

Interactive GUI with feedback

Attempts tracking

Reset game functionality
